## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

### Security Risks
This script includes options that can significantly reduce system security:
- Disabling Windows Defender real-time protection
- Delaying Windows Updates
- Disabling User Account Control (UAC)
- Modifying critical system services

### System Stability
- Incorrect modifications can cause system instability
- Some optimizations may break certain applications
- Registry changes are permanent until reversed

### Data Loss Risk
- Debloat operations remove applications and data
- Some optimizations clear caches and temporary files
- Always backup important data before use

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Recommendations

1. **Create Restore Point**: `System Properties ‚Üí System Protection ‚Üí Create`
2. **Backup Data**: Important files, documents, and configurations
3. **Test First**: Use in a virtual machine or test environment
4. **Research Options**: Understand what each tweak does before applying
5. **Monitor System**: Watch for stability issues after changes

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Debloat Selection
The custom debloat menu allows granular control:
```
Enter numbers separated by spaces (e.g., "1 5 10 15"):
38. All of the above (Complete removal)
39. Back to Debloat Menu
```

### Service Management
Advanced users can manage Windows services through the script's service optimization features.
